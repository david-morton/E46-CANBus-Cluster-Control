# E46-CANBus-Cluster-Control

This is a very simple program written for the Arduino which I intend on using
to control my BMW E46 instrument cluster as part of an engine swap project.

The ultimate goal is to use two CAN interfaces to read the Nissan Consult protocol
and then publish translated messages onto the BMW CAN bus for the instrument cluster
to read.
